Welcome to ***Neurosurgery Cases***.

Inspired by websites [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Sci-Hub](https://www.sci-hub.st/), [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/), and [Neuroangio](http://neuroangio.org/), etc., we aspire to create one based on [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and plug-in [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). Here, we share interesting neurosurgery cases.

Wanna share your own cases? [Contact us](mailto:contact@neurosurgerycases.com) and we can make it happen. :)

Some of the imaging have watermarks on. If you are interested in getting a copy without watermarks, you can [contact us](mailto:contact@neurosurgerycases.com).

**How do I use this website?**

The main layout consists of three columns from left to right: site roadmap, article, and page navigation (at the bottom on mobile devices).

- _Site roadmap_: Contains folders and links to specific pages.
- _Article_: Features interesting cases.
- _Page navigation_: Facilitates bi-directional linking to different places and back.

If you are not sure about an abbreviation, [[Notes/Index, Abbreviations\|here]] is the reference.

**What if the imagines are too small to discern the details?**

All the images are stored as PNG^[[PNG - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG)] and can be magnified without losing the pixels.
