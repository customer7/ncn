Inspired by websites [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Sci-Hub](https://www.sci-hub.st/), [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/), and [Neuroangio](http://neuroangio.org/), etc., we aspire to create one based on [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and plug-in [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/).
