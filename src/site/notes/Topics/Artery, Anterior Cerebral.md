The **anterior cerebral artery** is one of the two terminal branches of the [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]]. It travels medially into the interhemispheric space, supplying the medial anterior part of the cerebra and other midline structures.

## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/a3WJzlv.jpg)
This patient presented with an acute left M1 occlusion. Without cross-filling of the contralateral ACA through the [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Communicating\|ACOM]], this DSA presents a clear image of the left ACA and its branches (although not in the classic textbook manner).

1. [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|Ophthalmic artery]]
2. [[Topics/Artery, Middle Cerebral\|MCA]] (occluded)
3. Medial lenticulostriate arteries
4. A1 (horizontal/pre-communicating segment)
5. A common branch of 6 and 7
6. Orbitofrontal artery
7. Frontopolar artery
8. A2 (vertical/post-communicating/infracallosal segment)
9. Callosomarginal artery (somewhat small)
10. Anteromedial frontal branches
11. A3 (precallosal segment)
12. Intermediomedial frontal branches
13. Posteromedial frontal and paracentral branches
14. A4 (supracallosal segment)
15. A5 (postcallosal segment)
16. Precuneal branches

### 2 A2 Trifurcation

This patient presented with a severe headache and diffuse [[Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid\|SAH]] on CT head. 3D reconstruction from the CTA head showed a small [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Communicating\|ACOM]] aneurysm, a hypoplastic/atretic left A1, and an A2 trifurcation variation (**A**, **B**, and **C**). Figures (**D**) and (**E**) demonstrate standard [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] PA and lateral views. Figures (**F**) and (**G**) are zoomed-in post-coiling working angle views of the aneurysm.

### 3 Azygous ACA

This CTA shows an Azygous ACA with no ACOM. This anomaly is reported to be associated with saccular aneurysms.^[[Saccular Aneurysm of the Azygos Anterior Cerebral Artery: Three Case Reports - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588199/)]
