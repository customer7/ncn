The **posterior inferior cerebellar artery**, AKA **PICA**, normally originates from the intracranial [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] (V4). In some cases, the PICA could be absent with a big [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Inferior Cerebellar\|AICA]].

## Cases

### 1

This patient presented with cerebellar IPH with IVH. DSA showed diffuse vascular irregularities, such as the [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|BA]] and left [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Inferior Cerebellar\|AICA]], without an obvious cause for the hemorrhage. Interestingly, there is an absence of bilateral PICAs

This right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|vertebral artery]] injection yielded several noteworthy observations:
1. Identification of an anastomosis (<span style="color: cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) between a muscular branch of the right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] (<span style="color: palegreen">green</span> arrow) and the right [[Topics/Artery, Occipital\|occipital artery]] (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow).
2. Observation of a reduction in the size of the VA intracranially, resulting in the equalization of sizes between the PICA (<span style="color: SaddleBrown">brown</span> arrow) and distal VA.

### 3

This left [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] revealed an extra-cranial origin (<span style="color: yellow">yellow</span> arrow) of the left PICA. It is imperative to acknowledge this anatomical variation prior to conducting sub-occipital craniotomy or atlanto-occipital procedures.

This right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] demonstrated two interesting findings: 1. The right VA ends at PICA; 2. There is a PICA origin aneurysm (top row). The aneurysm was subsequently coiled without complications (bottom row).
