The **posterior inferior cerebellar artery**, AKA **PICA**, normally originates from the intracranial [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] (V4). In some cases, the PICA could be absent with a big [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Inferior Cerebellar\|AICA]].

This patient presented with cerebellar IPH with IVH. DSA showed diffuse vascular irregularities, such as the [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|BA]] and left [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Inferior Cerebellar\|AICA]], without an obvious cause for the hemorrhage. Interestingly, there is an absence of bilateral PICAs.
