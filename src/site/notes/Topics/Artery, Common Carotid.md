The **common carotid artery** (**CCA**) bifurcates into the [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]] and [[Topics/Artery, External Carotid\|external carotid artery]].

## Cases

In general, the [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] origin (<span style="color: palegreen">green</span> arrow) is postero-lateral to the [[Topics/Artery, External Carotid\|ECA]] origin (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow), as seen on this left CCA roadmap.

### 2

This patient presented with a sudden onset of right hemiparesis and dysphasia. A severe left CCA origin stenosis (**A**, <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span> arrow) was revealed on the [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] which obstructed the catheterization of the left CCA. By the time the right CCA/ [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] was catheterized, contrast stasis was still present in the left CCA (**B**) due to insufficient forward flow. A left M2 occlusion (**C**, <span style="color: red">red</span> arrow) was confirmed on the right ICA injection by cross-filling of the contrast via the [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Communicating\|ACOM artery]]. Also identified was the left [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|ACA]] collaterals (**D**, <span style="color: palegreen">green</span> arrows) and retrograde flow into the left ICA (**C** and **D**). A direct left CCA puncture under the guidance of the ultrasound was performed and a TICI 2B reperfusion was achieved after mechanical thrombectomy (**E** and **F**).
