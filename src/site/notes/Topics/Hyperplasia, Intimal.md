## Cases

This patient had an incidentally found right [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Choroidal\|anterior choroidal artery]] aneurysm, which was treated with flow diversion stent (**A**,**B**, and **C**). Six-month follow-up [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] revealed non-opacification of the right [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|ACA]] and intra-stent intimal hyperplasia (**D**). The patient had no neurological deficits and was kept on dual anti-platelet therapy but lost follow-up. Several years later, the same patient presented with a ruptured contralateral (left) [[Topics/Aneurysm, PCOM\|posterior communicating artery aneurysm]]. DSA on the right side showed resolution of the intimal hyperplasia (**E** and **F**).
