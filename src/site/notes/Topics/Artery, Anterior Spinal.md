This right VA injection depicts a fenestrated basilar artery (<span style="color: yellow">yellow</span> arrow) alongside an anterior spinal artery (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow). The origin (<span style="color: orange">orange</span> arrow) of the anterior spinal artery is from the intracranial right V4, just proximal to the formation of the basilar artery.
