Post-angiographic CT head of this patient showed diffuse high attenuation in the subarachnoid and intraventricular spaces, with uncertainty regarding contrast or blood (**A**, **C**). A repeat CT head in several hours would likely demonstrate the fading of the contrast. However, dual-energy CT head with iodine subtraction (**B**, **D**) provides an instant answer.
