**Hypoxia** refers to a lack of oxygen in an organ or tissue. The brain is highly susceptible to hypoxia and some cells start dying less than 5 minutes after the deprivation of oxygen supply ([[Topics/Hypoxia#1\|Case 1]]).

The *pyramidal neurons* located in the *CA1* field of the *hippocampus*, AKA *Sommer's sector*, are especially susceptible to hypoxia. This patient suffered hypoxia, and the brain MRI DWI (**A** and **C**) and ADC (**B** and **D**) sequences only showed [[Topics/Stroke, Ischemic\|ischemic stroke]] at the bilateral hippocampi, with left side (yellow arrows) greater than right side.
