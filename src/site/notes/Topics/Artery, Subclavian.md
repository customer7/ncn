The right **subclavian artery** usually shares a common origin with the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] called the brachiocephalic artery. However, it could originate directly from the aortic arch and be called **lusorian artery**.

## Cases

### 1 Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery

**CTA Neck**
![](https://i.imgur.com/CVxdMX9.jpg)
The **aberrant right subclavian artery**/**lusorian artery** (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) which can be easily ascertained on CTA neck, is considered a relative contraindication for radial access.^[[Radial Access via Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery | neuroangio.org](https://neuroangio.org/sample-page/case-archives/radial-access-via-aberrant-right-subclavian-artery/)] <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: right CCA. <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: left CCA. <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: left subclavian artery. <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: right VA. Pink star: esophagus. White diamond: trachea. (Unfortunately, this is not an ideal study due to the suboptimal timing and contrast contamination in the adjacent veins.)

**CTA Chest**

This patient presented after a chest trauma. There is also an aberrant right subclavian artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). Also, please note the right pulmonary contusion and the chest tube.

An interesting observation from the 3D reconstruction of this aberrant right subclavian artery from the CTA is that the right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] originates from the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]].
