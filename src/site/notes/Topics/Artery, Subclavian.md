The right **subclavian artery** usually shares a common origin with the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] called the brachiocephalic artery. However, it could originate directly from the aortic arch and be called **lusorian artery** ([[Topics/Artery, Subclavian#1 Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery\|Case 1]]).

Pre-vertebral subclavian artery stenosis/occlusion can cause subclavian artery steal syndrome ([[Topics/Artery, Subclavian#\|Artery, Subclavian#]]).

## Cases

### 1 Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery

#### 1.1

**CTA Neck**
![](https://i.imgur.com/CVxdMX9.jpg)
The **aberrant right subclavian artery**/**lusorian artery** (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) which can be easily ascertained on CTA neck, is considered a relative contraindication for radial access.^[[Radial Access via Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery | neuroangio.org](https://neuroangio.org/sample-page/case-archives/radial-access-via-aberrant-right-subclavian-artery/)] <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: right CCA. <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: left CCA. <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: left subclavian artery. <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: right VA. Pink star: esophagus. White diamond: trachea. (Unfortunately, this is not an ideal study due to the suboptimal timing and contrast contamination in the adjacent veins.)

#### 1.2

**CTA Chest**
![](https://i.imgur.com/f5ZB1F7.png)
This patient presented after a chest trauma. There is also an aberrant right subclavian artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). Also, please note the right pulmonary contusion and the chest tube.

- <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: Left [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: Left subclavian artery. 
- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- <span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: Left [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- <span style="color:black">Black</span> arrow: Right long thoracic artery. 
- Magenta star: Esophagus/NGT. 
- White diamond: Trachea/ETT.

- <span style="color: palegreen">Green</span> arrow: Left CCA.

- <span style="color: orange">Orange</span> arrow: Aberrant right subclavian artery.
\*The right VA is a small artery and is not shown.

#### 1.5

An interesting observation from the 3D reconstruction of this aberrant right subclavian artery from the CTA is that the right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] originates from the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] (<span style="color: white">white</span> arrow).

- <span style="color: red">Red</span> arrow: right aberrant [[Topics/Artery, Subclavian\|subclavian artery]].

### 2 Left Subclavian Artery Origin Occlusion

#### 2.1

This patient was noticed to have discrepancy of the blood pressures on bilateral upper extremities. Intra-operative left subclavian artery and right vertebral artery angiographies revealed pre-vertebral occlusion of the left subclavian artery.

Right vertebral artery run in the same patient showed retrograde flow into the left vertebral artery and left subclavian artery. Notice there is also absence of bilateral posterior cerebral arteries due to bilateral fetal posterior communicating arteries.

#### 2.2

This fluoroscopy demonstrated an occluded left [[Topics/Artery, Subclavian\|subclavian artery]] origin (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow).

- <span style="color: white">White</span> arrow: Right brachiocephalic artery.
- <span style="color: orange">Orange</span> arrow: Left [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|common carotid artery]].

Right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] injection showed retrograde flow into the left VA.
