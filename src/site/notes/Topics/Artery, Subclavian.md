The right **subclavian artery** usually shares a common origin with the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] called the brachiocephalic artery. However, it could originate directly from the aortic arch and be called **lusorian artery**, (see case presentation from [[Topics/Access, Radial Artery\|radial artery access]]-[[Topics/Access, Radial Artery#3\|Case 3]]).
