The **anterior choroidal artery** (AChA) originates from the [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]], distal to the [[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]]. The *plexal point* marks where it enters the lateral ventricle.^[[Anterior choroidal artery | Radiology Reference Article | Radiopaedia.org](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/anterior-choroidal-artery)]

On this right ICA injection, from proximal to distal, the [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow), the [[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow), and the AChA originate from the intracranial [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] (**A**). The AChA can be clearly discerned along its course both on the PA (**A**) and lateral (**B** and **C**) views. After making the turn at the plexal point (<span style="color:white">white</span> arrow), the AChA enters the right lateral ventricle to supply the [[Topics/Plexus, Choroid\|choroid plexus]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). What seems to be a [[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] origin aneurysm vs. infundibulum on the lateral views is actually the [[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] itself making a turn (**D**).
