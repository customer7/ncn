A form of acquired facial synkinesis manifesting as involuntary **eyelid closure** on **jaw opening**. Often follows an aberrant regeneration of the facial nerve after a peripheral facial palsy.

## Mechanism

Eyelid closure occurs due to orbicularis oculi (CN VII) contraction rather than inhibition of levator palpebrae superioris ([[Topics/Nerve, Oculomotor\|CN III]]) as is seen in [[Topics/Phenomenon, Inverse Marcus Gunn\|inverse Marcus Gunn phenomenon]]

## Pearls

- Eyelid closure (CN VII)
- Jaw opening
