In this article, we gathered cases with interesting external carotid-internal carotid anastomoses.

## Cases

### 1 MMA and Ophthalmic Artery

#### 1.1

**DSA - Right ICA Injection (PA \[Top\] and Lateral \[Bottom\])**
![](https://i.imgur.com/O3RCMBz.jpg)
The right [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrows) is arising from the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow), as observed during an injection into the right ICA. By the way, did you notice the aneurysm?

#### 1.2

**Right ICA Injection**
![](https://i.imgur.com/tzvd5PW.jpg)
This patient presented with stroke activation, and the right [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]] run showed a right M 1 occlusion (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow). Interestingly, an anastomosis was also observed between the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) and the right [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow). Subsequent mechanical thrombectomy achieved a TICI 2 C reperfusion (inset images).

(**B**): Lateral view.
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: Anterior branch of the MMA.
<span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: Posterior branch of the MMA.

#### 1.3

![](https://i.imgur.com/z5i4GBb.jpeg)
This patient presented with chronic complete occlusion of the right cervical [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]]. DSA showed an anastomosis between the right [[Artery, Maxillary\|internal maxillary artery]] branches and the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrowhead). There is also cross-filling from the left ICA injection via the patent [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Communicating\|anterior communicating artery]] (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> arrow).

(**A**): Right CCA injection, PA view.
(**B**): Right CCA injection, lateral view.
(**C**): Left CCA injection, PA view.

<span style="color:red">Red</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Occipital\|occipital artery]].
<span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Superficial Temporal\|superficial temporal artery]].
<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Brown</span> arrow: [[Artery, Maxillary\|Internal maxillary artery]].
<span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|Middle meningeal artery]].
<span style="color:white">White</span> arrow: Choroidal blush.

#### 1.4

On the right [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] run (top row), the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) briefly opacified and disappeared with the retrograde flow. On the right [[Topics/Artery, External Carotid\|ECA]] run (bottom row), an anastomosis (<span style="color:red">red</span> circle) between the frontal branch (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) of the right [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|MMA]] (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow) and right ophthalmic artery was observed with robust flow from the former to the latter. Note: The anastomosis point was right where the ophthalmic artery forward flow stopped on the ICA run.

> [!warning] Caution!
> This type of anastomosis poses a potential risk of vision loss in the setting of MMA embolization. 

<span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: Posterior branch of the MMA.
<span style="color:Magenta">Magenta</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Superficial Temporal\|Superficial temporal artery]].
<span style="color:SaddleBrown">Brown</span> arrow: [[Artery, Maxillary\|Internal maxillary artery]].
<span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|Internal carotid artery]].
<span style="color:white">White</span> arrow: Choroidal blush.

### 2 Occipital-Vertebral Anastomosis

#### 2.1

**DSA - Left ECA Injection (PA \[Left\] and Lateral \[Right\])**
![](https://i.imgur.com/kHKRuzV.jpg)
On this left ECA angiogram, an anastomosis (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) can be seen between the left occipital artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) and the left VA (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow).

- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|Basilar artery]].
- <span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Superficial Temporal\|Superficial temporal artery]].
- <span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|Middle meningeal artery]].

#### 2.2

![](https://i.imgur.com/757AQH4.jpg)

On this ECA angiogram, an anastomosis (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) can be seen between the occipital artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) and the VA (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow).

- <span style="color:SaddleBrown">Brown</span> arrow: [[Artery, Maxillary\|Internal maxillary artery]]
- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|Basilar artery]].
- <span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Superficial Temporal\|Superficial temporal artery]].
- <span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|Middle meningeal artery]].

### 3

![](https://i.imgur.com/rhWp7hA.jpg)
This patient presented with a ruptured paraophthalmic aneurysm that necessitated urgent coiling. Subsequently, a flow diverter embolization was carried out in a delayed manner. Notably, there existed an ophthalmic artery origin stenosis (**A**, <span style="color:red">red</span> arrow), showcasing normal flow (**B**). However, following the deployment of the flow diverter, a hindrance in the flow (**C** and **D**, <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow) was observed. An [[Topics/Artery, External Carotid\|external carotid artery]] injection (**E**) revealed a choroidal blush (**F**, <span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow), signifying an EC-ophthalmic artery anastomosis.
