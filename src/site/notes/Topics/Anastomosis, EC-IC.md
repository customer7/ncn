In this article, we gathered cases with interesting external carotid-internal carotid anastomoses.

## Cases

### 1

**DSA - Right ICA Injection (PA \[Top\] and Lateral \[Bottom\])**

The right [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrows) is arising from the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow), as observed during an injection into the right ICA. By the way, did you notice the aneurysm?

### 2

**DSA - Left ECA Injection (PA \[Left\] and Lateral \[Right\])**

On this left ECA angiogram, an anastomosis (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) can be seen between the left occipital artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) and the left VA (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow).

- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|Basilar artery]].
- <span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Superficial Temporal\|Superficial temporal artery]].
- <span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|Middle meningeal artery]].

### 3

**Right ICA Injection**

This patient presented with stroke activation, and the right [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]] run showed a right M1 occlusion (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow). Interestingly, an anastomosis was also observed between the right [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) and the right [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow). Subsequent mechanical thrombectomy achieved a TICI 2C reperfusion (inset images).

### 4

This patient presented with a ruptured paraophthalmic aneurysm that necessitated urgent coiling. Subsequently, a flow diverter embolization was carried out in a delayed manner. Notably, there existed an ophthalmic artery origin stenosis (**A**, <span style="color:red">red</span> arrow), showcasing normal flow (**B**). However, following the deployment of the flow diverter, a hindrance in the flow (**C** and **D**, <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow) was observed. An [[Topics/Artery, External Carotid\|external carotid artery]] injection (**E**) revealed a choroidal blush (**F**, <span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow), signifying an EC-ophthalmic artery anastomosis.
