The **hyperdense artery sign** could be an early indication of an [[Topics/Stroke, Ischemic\|ischemic stroke]] secondary to an embolic occlusion of the corresponding artery.

## Cases

This patient presented with an acute onset of left hemiparesis and altered mental status. A CT head without contrast showed a hyperdense [[Topics/Artery, Basilar\|basilar artery]] (yellow arrow in **A** and **C**), indicating embolic thrombus. This hyperdense sign was even more convincing since the patient had an old CT head (**B** and **D**) to compare with. Due to a contrast allergy, no CTA head was obtained at the OSH. The patient was subsequently intubated, and DSA confirmed the basilar occlusion (**E** and **F**).  Mechanical thrombectomy yielded a TICI 2B reperfusion.
