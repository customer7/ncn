The **posterior communicating artery**, AKA **PCOM artery**, connects the [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]] with the [[Topics/Artery, Posterior Cerebral\|posterior cerebral artery]] (PCA). It is called **fetal** PCOM artery if it is bigger than the first segment (P1) of the PCA ([[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating#1\|Case 1]]). There are perforators originating from the PCOM artery ([[Topics/Artery, Posterior Communicating#1\|Case 1]]) that should be carefully preserved during PCOM artery aneurysm clipping.

This patient has a left fetal PCOM artery (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow) supplying the left PCA (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) and shows an absence of the left P1. On the right VA injection, the right PCOM (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow) can be discerned with a perforator (<span style="color:black">black</span> arrow) heading toward the right thalamus. Additionally, there is a duplicate left SCA (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). By the way, did you notice the hidden aneurysm? :)
