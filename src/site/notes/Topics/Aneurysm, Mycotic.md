A patient with a history of MSSA bacteremia presented with severe headache and left hemiparesis. CT head showed a large right frontal [[Topics/Hemorrhage, Intracerebral\|ICH]], and CTA head showed a peripheral right MCA mycotic aneurysm. The patient subsequently underwent a right craniotomy and clipping of the aneurysm. Post-op [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm.
