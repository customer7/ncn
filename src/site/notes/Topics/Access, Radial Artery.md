With the introduction of various catheters designed for radial access, the **radial artery access** has been gaining popularity recently. The [[Topics/Catheter, Simmons\|Simmons catheters]] are typically the go-to choice for selecting target arteries.

## Tips and Tricks

### Medicine

- A small amount of local anesthetic is extremely useful in an awake patient to mitigate the pain caused by needle puncture and sheath placement
- Spasmolytic cocktail is typically composed of two vasodilators and heparin
	- 200-400 mcg of nitroglycerin
	- 2.5-5.0 mg of verapamil
	- 2,000 units of heparin
- Verapamil is acidic and will cause uncomfortable feeling, thus needs to be diluted before injecting
- Heparin dose can be adjusted depending on the purpose of the angiography

### Avoiding Complications

- When injecting the anesthetics, make sure all the air in the syringe is purged out, as subcutaneous air could severely interfere with the ultrasound imaging and obscure the artery.
- When injecting a spasmolytic cocktail into an awake patient, make sure to inform the patient and hold the patient's arm in place to prevent sudden movement of the arm due to discomfort.

## Cases

### 1

**Ultrasound-Guided Radial Artery Puncture**

**A**: Frequently, there is an accompanying vein (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) running alongside the radial artery (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrowhead). 
**B**: Applying gentle pressure on the wrist will cause the vein to collapse, while the artery remains full with pulsations. Observe the slight "upward shift" of both the collapsed vein and the artery (closer to the skin).

### 3 Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery

**CTA Neck**
![](https://i.imgur.com/CVxdMX9.jpg)
The **aberrant right subclavian artery**/**lusorian artery** (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) which can be easily ascertained on CTA neck, is considered a relative contraindication for radial access.^[[Radial Access via Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery | neuroangio.org](https://neuroangio.org/sample-page/case-archives/radial-access-via-aberrant-right-subclavian-artery/)] <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: right CCA. <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: left CCA. <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: left subclavian artery. <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: right VA. Pink star: esophagus. White diamond: trachea. (Unfortunately, this is not an ideal study due to the suboptimal timing and contrast contamination in the adjacent veins.)

**CTA Chest**

This patient presented after a chest trauma. There is also an aberrant right subclavian artery (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). Also, please note the right pulmonary contusion and the chest tube.

- <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: Left [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: Left subclavian artery. 
- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: Right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- <span style="color:cyan">Cyan</span> arrow: Left [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- <span style="color:black">Black</span> arrow: Right long thoracic artery. 
- Magenta star: Esophagus/NGT. 
- White diamond: Trachea/ETT.

This angiography revealed a tortuous right radial artery origin with adjacent two U-turns. The Glidewire was too stiff to safely navigate through these two turns (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow). Consequently, the decision was made to abandon radial access and switch to a femoral access. In cases where the right radial artery remains the only viable option for access, one could consider using a microwire to guide the selection of the brachial artery, followed by a microcatheter to straighten the radial artery origin. 

- <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> arrow: The tip of the sheath.

- <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: Ulnar artery.

### 5

The right [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] (pink arrow) is typically the first artery to catheterize in diagnostic cerebral angiography via the radial access.

(**A**): In this pre-operative CTA neck 3D reconstruction view, the right VA origin (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow) can be clearly recognized with its relative location to the tip of the distal right subclavian curve (<span style="color:white">white</span> arrow).
(**B**): Advance the catheter tip (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> arrow) to the estimated VA origin and obtain a roadmap to assist in artery catheterization.

An alternative method to localize the right VA origin would be to advance the catheter tip more distally and then retract it while puffing contrast to opacify it.
