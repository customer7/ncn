The **superficial middle cerebral vein** (**SMCV**), AKA **Sylvian vein**, corses along the [[Fissure, Sylvian\|Sylvian fissure]] posteroanteriorly, curves around the tip of the [[Lobe, Temporal\|temporal lobe]], and drains into the [[Sinus, Sphenoparietal\|sphenoparietal sinus]] or [[Sinus, Cavernous\|cavernous sinus]].

## Cases
### 1

A patient presented with right M2 occlusion. After mechanical thrombectomy, there were several early draining veins seen on DSA including the SMCV (arrows).

- Early veinous filling after mechanical thrombectomy is found to be associated with post-operative hyper-perfusion and potential intraparenchymal hemorrhage.^[[Early Cerebral Vein After Endovascular Ischemic Stroke Treatment Predicts Symptomatic Reperfusion Hemorrhage | Stroke](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.021402?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)]^[[Early venous filling after reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720303323?via%3Dihub)]
