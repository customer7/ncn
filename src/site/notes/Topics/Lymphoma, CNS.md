Central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas are defined by involvement of the brain, eyes, or spinal cord, and are categorized as primary (isolated to the CNS) or secondary (disseminated from systemic sites). They present with varied radiographic features on contrast-enhanced [[Topics/Imaging, Magnetic Resonance\|MRI]] (see below cases). These tumors are highly sensitive to chemo- and radiation therapy, and aggressive surgical resection is not considered the standard treatment. Thus, when CNS lymphoma is suspected, it is prudent to prioritize a minimally invasive stereotactic needle biopsy or a mini-craniotomy for definitive histopathology.^[[Diagnostics and treatment delay in primary central nervous system lymphoma: What the neurosurgeon should know - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11164806/)] Notably, corticosteroids should be withheld prior to tissue acquisition whenever possible to avoid the "vanishing tumor" phenomenon, which can lead to non-diagnostic results.^[[Histopathological Diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma after Therapy with Corticosteroids or Anticoagulants](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/6/1157)]

## Cases

### 1

A senior patient presented with altered mental status. CT head without contrast in the emergency department showed a large hyperdense lesion (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow) at the left basal ganglia with surrounding hypodense edema (<span style="color: yellow">yellow</span> arrow), causing compression of the left lateral ventricle and midline shift. Brain [[Topics/Imaging, Magnetic Resonance\|MRI]] with contrast demonstrated a similar heterogenously enhanced lesion. Differential diagnosis included CNS lymphoma, meningioma, and metastasis, etc. A left frontal stereotactic needle biopsy was performed and pathology showed a high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
