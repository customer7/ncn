The embolization of [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] has been utilized in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.^[[Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization for Chronic Subdural Hematoma: A Review of Established and Emerging Embolic Agents | Stroke: Vascular and Interventional Neurology](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/SVIN.123.000906)]

The PA (**A** and **C**) and lateral (**B** and **D**) projections of a frontal division (<span style="color: orange">orange</span> arrow) [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] revealed an anastomosis (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow) between the [[Topics/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] (<span style="color: SaddleBrown">brown</span> arrow) and the [[Topics/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (<span style="color: Magenta">magenta</span> arrow). In order to mitigate the risk of vision impairment, selective embolization of the parietal division (<span style="color: black">black</span> arrow) was first performed utilizing n-BCA glue. Notably, the glue penetrated retrogradely into the distal frontal division (**E** and **F**), effectively achieving the surgical goal with safety and success.
