Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain without contrast could be utilized to detect intracranial vascular abnormalities including aneurysms. 
(**A**): This time of flight (TOF) angiography, T1WI without contrast image clearly reveals a large, partially thrombosed right cavernous [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] aneurysm. 
(**B**): This T1WI with contrast image demonstrates a ghosting artifact along the phase-encoding direction, likely caused by pulsation within the aneurysm.^[[Pulsation, and Other Artifacts | Radiology Key](https://radiologykey.com/pulsation-and-other-artifacts/)]
