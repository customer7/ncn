**Dual-Volume 3D Angiography** reduces artifacts in previously treated aneurysms and provides a sharper image of the stents and coils.^[[Added value of three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography, using dual-volume reconstruction technique, in post-treatment follow-up of cerebral aneurysms | Egyptian Journal of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine | Full Text](https://ejrnm.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43055-019-0037-4)]

## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/thpNHHm.jpg)
This patient was previously treated with stent-assisted coiling of bilateral MCA bifurcation aneurysms. This 3D angiography utilizes a dual-volume technique and differentiates the stents, coils, and arteries at different blending values.
(**A**): Volume-Blending: -100, providing an excellent view of the stents and coils.
(**B**): Volume-Blending: 0, presenting a mixed view.
(**C**): Volume-Blending: +100, offering an excellent view of the arteries.

This patient has a history of right craniotomy and clipping of an [[Topics/Artery, Middle Cerebral\|MCA]] bifurcation aneurysm. This 3D angiography utilizes a dual-volume technique and differentiates the clips, plates, and arteries at different blending values.
(**A**): Volume-Blending: -100, providing an excellent view of the clips and plates.
(**B**): Volume-Blending: 0, presenting a mixed view.
(**C**): Volume-Blending: +100, offering an excellent view of the arteries.
