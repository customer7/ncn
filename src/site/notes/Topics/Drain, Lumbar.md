A **lumbar drain** is indicated for various conditions, such as CSF leak, NPH, intraoperative CSF drainage, etc. It is usually placed under fluoroscopy, as shown in [[Topics/Drain, Lumbar#1\|Case 1]].

## Cases

### 1

The patient is placed prone on the biplane table, with their lower back sterilized and draped.

(**A**): Adjust the A-plane image intensifier caudally and either in the LAO or RAO position to maximize the targetâ€”the window of the interlaminar spaces (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrows).<sup>*</sup> The 14G Tuohy spinal needle is placed on the patient's back to localize the target. The skin underneath the needle tip is marked with a marker. Local anesthetic is then injected around the marker.
(**B**): Following the PA angle, the needle is gently advanced through the skin into the soft tissue. Take a PA view to aim the needle toward the target. Take a true lateral view to evaluate the depth of the needle tip.
(**C** and **D**): The needle tip is now advanced into the intrathecal space.
(**E**): After removing the inner stylus, the drain catheter was placed into the intrathecal space through the needle. Take a lateral view to confirm the catheter travels rostrally.

\* The target should be below the L1/L2 level to avoid injury to the spinal cord/conus medullaris. In this case, the catheter enters the L3/L4 level.
