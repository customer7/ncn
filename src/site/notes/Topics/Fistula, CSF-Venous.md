## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZozOhHe.jpg)
This patient presented with progressively worsening headaches. Brain MRI with and without contrast suggested intracranial hypotension with bilateral subdural hygromas (**A**), diffuse pathymeningeal enhancement (**B**, **C**, and **D**), and crowded foramen magnum (**E**). MRI neuraxis with and without contrast also showed diffuse dural enhancement (not shown) without an identifiable CSF leak. A CT myelogram showed contrast extravasation within the left neural foramen at C7-T1 (**F** and **G**), suspecting a CSF-venous fistula. The patient subsequently underwent a diagnostic venogram (**H** and **I**) and Onyx embolization of the left C7-T1 paraspinal venous network (**J** and **K**).^[[A Novel Endovascular Therapy for CSF Hypotension Secondary to CSF-Venous Fistulas - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115355/)] Post-operatively, patient's headache resolved.
