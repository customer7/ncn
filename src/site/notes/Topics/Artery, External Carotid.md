The **external carotid artery** (**ECA**) is one of the two branches of the [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|common carotid artery]] (CCA). It supplies the face and neck.

It seems there is an anastomosis between the cavernous segment of the right [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] and the right [[Artery, Maxillary\|internal maxillary artery]] (yellow arrow).

#### Comments

- The absence of the right ECA could be due to congenital vs complete occlusion as a result of severe atherosclerotic disease.
