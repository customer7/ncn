## Anatomy

The **posterior meningeal artery** is the largest artery supplying the dura of the [[Posterior Cranial Fossa\|posterior cranial fossa]], paramedial and medial portions of the [[Dura\|dura]] covering the cerebellar convexity.

It may arise from the [[Artery, Ascending Pharyngeal\|ascending pharyngeal artery]], or less commonly, the [[Topics/Artery, Occipital\|occipital artery]]. 

It may enter the [[Cranial Vault\|cranial vault]] through the [[Jugular Foramen\|jugular foramen]], [[Foramen Magnum\|foramen magnum]], or the [[Hypoglossal Canal\|hypoglossal canal]].
