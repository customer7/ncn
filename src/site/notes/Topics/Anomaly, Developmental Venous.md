**Developmental venous anomaly** (**DVA**), AKA **cerebral venous angioma**, is a congenital venous malformation.

---

## Anatomy

It presents as caput medusae sign of multiple smaller veins draining into a single larger vein.

----

## Pathology

- About 20% are associated with cavernous malformation

---

## Radiographic Features

### MRI

- Visible on most sequences
- SWI is the preferred sequence to visualize DVA.
- T1WI with contrast could show enhancement.

### Angiography

- DVA can be seen in the venous phage
- No shunting
