**Intrathecal pumps** are instrumental in delivering medications directly into the intrathecal space, where they can intermix with the [[Topics/Fluid, Cerebrospinal\|CSF]] and exert their effects directly on the [[Topics/Cord, Spinal\|spinal cord]]. In cases where pump malfunction is suspected, X-ray interrogation serves a diagnostic tool to investigate potential radiographic causes and ensure proper device functionality ([[Topics/Pump, Intrathecal#1\|Case 1]]).

Step-by-Step Tutorial: Intrathecal Pump Interrogation Under Fluorosocpy

*Step 1: Placement of the Needle*
(**A**): Position the needle inside the catheter access port, as depicted in the PA view (<span style="color: Cyan">cyan</span> arrow).
(**B**): Verify the correct placement of the needle tip within the port through the lateral view (<span style="color: red">red</span> arrow).

*Step 2: Test Occlusion*
Aspirate to withdraw [[Topics/Fluid, Cerebrospinal\|CSF]]. 
- If clear back-flow of CSF is observed, aspirate as least 1 mL to clear the catheter of medication before proceeding to *Step 3*. 
- Absence of CSF return suggests an occlusion distal to the access port, necessitating a revision. Terminate the procedure.

*Step 3: Contrast Injection*
(**C**): Delicately inject 1-2 mL of contrast into the port and monitor flow within the catheter (<span style="color: black">black</span> arrow) using real-time fluoroscopy. Identify any contrast extravasation, indicative of catheter breakage.
(**D**): Detection of free-floating contrast within the intrathecal space (<span style="color: palegreen">green</span> arrow) confirms a patent catheter system. The <span style="color: cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow indicates the intrathecal catheter tip.

*Step 4: Device Check*
(**E**) and (**F**): Program the device to administer a small amount of the medication and verify its functionality on pre- (E) and post- (F) fluoroscopies, noting the rotation of the peristaltic pump (<span style="color: red">red</span> circle).

\*It is recommended to have a medical representative from the pump company present to assist with programming the device.
