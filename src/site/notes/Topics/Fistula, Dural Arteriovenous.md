This patient underwent bilateral [[Topics/Artery, Recurrent Meningeal\|middle meningeal artery]] embolizations to address bilateral [[Topics/Hematoma, Subdural\|subdural hematoma]]. Notably, during one of the left MMA injections, two asymptomatic dAVFs were identified. One of the fistulas was observed to drain into the superior sagittal sinus and the other one was drained into the left transverse-sigmoid junction (the most common location^[[Dural Arteriovenous Fistula - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532274/)]).
