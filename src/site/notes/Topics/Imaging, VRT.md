The **volume rendering technique**, AKA **VRT**, leverages two-dimensional data to depict anatomical structures in a three-dimensional manner. This method allows for the manipulation of images, including magnification, windowing, cropping, and rotation, to achieve the most advantageous visualization perspective.

In this particular case, the pre-operative VRT image (**A**) derived from the CTA head data aptly anticipated the intra-operative perspective required for the PA view. Accordingly, the patient's head was positioned in an extended manner and gently rotated to the right, mitigating the risk of extreme angles that might challenge image acquisition. Subsequently, intra-operative perspective mirroring the anticipated angle was successfully achieved, revealing clear visualization of the aneurysm neck and the origins of bilateral [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|A2]] (**B**). Navigating a microcatheter into the aneurysm proceeded smoothly without encountered difficulties (**C**), facilitating the subsequent successful coiling of the aneurysm (**D**). Post-coiling [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] depicted excellent occlusion of the aneurysm and patent bilateral A2 (**E**).
