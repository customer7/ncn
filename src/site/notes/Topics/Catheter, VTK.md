The **VTK** catheter is designed to select the target artery from the aortic arch ([[Topics/Catheter, VTK#1\|Case 1]]), especially in type II and III. It typically forms without the need of a wire. Its design does not involve advancing it into the target artery; instead, it remains in the aortic arch.

## Cases

### 1

This case illustrates how the VTK catheter can be utilized to select the right ICA.

(**A**): Advance the VTK catheter into the ascending aorta and gently retract it until the tip (orange arrow) "pops" into the right CCA, as confirmed on this PA roadmap.
(**B**): Simultaneously captured with (A), this lateral view focuses more rostrally on the CCA and distal cervical ICA.
(**C** and **D**): Gently advance the Glidewire tip (black arrow) into the distal cervical ICA (D) to straighten the VTK catheter (C).
(**E**): Slowly advance the guide catheter, in this case, the Walrus catheter, into the CCA while firmly holding the VTK catheter.
(**F**): Continue advancing the Walrus until its tip (green arrow) reaches the distal cervical ICA in a stable condition.

- Orange arrow: VTK tip.
- Blue arrow: Primary curve.
- Red arrow: Secondary curve.
- Cyan arrow: Tertiary curve.
- Green arrow: Walrus tip.

This patient has a bovine-type arch, and the VTK catheter makes the selection of the left [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] straightforward.
