The **VTK** catheter is designed to select the target artery from the aortic arch ([[Topics/Catheter, VTK#1\|Case 1]]), especially in type II and III. It typically forms without the need of a wire. Its design does not involve advancing it into the target artery; instead, it remains in the aortic arch.

## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/b3c3pEF.jpg)
This case illustrates how the VTK catheter can be utilized to select the right ICA.

(**A**): Advance the VTK catheter into the ascending aorta and gently retract it until the tip (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> arrow) "pops" into the right CCA, as confirmed on this PA roadmap.
(**B**): Simultaneously captured with (A), this lateral view focuses more rostrally on the CCA and distal cervical ICA.
(**C** and **D**): Gently advance the Glidewire tip (<span style="color:black">black</span> arrow) into the distal cervical ICA (D) to straighten the VTK catheter (C).
(**E**): Slowly advance the guide catheter, in this case, the Walrus catheter, into the CCA while firmly holding the VTK catheter.
(**F**): Continue advancing the Walrus until its tip (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow) reaches the distal cervical ICA in a stable condition.

### 2 Bovine Arch

#### 2.1

This patient has a bovine-type arch, and the VTK catheter makes the selection of the left [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] straightforward.

#### 2.2

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ji0ohbF.jpeg)
To achieve catheterization of the right [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]], the VTK catheter tip (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> arrow) is first placed in the bovine arch to obtain a roadmap (**A**). The Glidewire (<span style="color:black">black</span> arrow) first enters the left CCA following the trajectory of the VTK catheter (**B**). Gentle push of the VTK catheter will "pop" its tip out of the left ICA into the brachiocephalic artery (**C**). Gently advance the Glidewire into the right CCA until the VTK catheter is strengthened (**D**). Firmly hold the VTK catheter and advance the guide catheter (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow) to follow the Glidewire into the right CCA (**E**).
