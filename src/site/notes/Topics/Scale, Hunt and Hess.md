The **Hunt and Hess scale**^[[Surgical risk as related to time of intervention in the repair of intracranial aneurysms - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5635959/)] is used to classify the severity of a [[Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid\|subarachnoid hemorrhage]] based on clinical condition. It can be used to predict patient's prognosis/outcome.

| Grade | Clinical Presentation                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Asyptomatic, mild ==headache==, slight nuchal rigidity                                                 |
| 2     | Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than ==cranial nerve palsy== |
| 3     | ==Drowsiness==, confusion, mild focal neurologic deficit                                               |
| 4     | Stupor, moderate-severe ==hemiparesis==                                                                |
| 5     | Coma, ==decerebrate posturing==                                                                        |

\* Extra one point is given for severe systemic disease or severe vasospasm on angiography. 

**Comments**
When the Hunt and Hess scale is applied upon the patient's arrival at the hospital, it could be misleading. For example, a comatose patient with significant hydrocephalus could become a GCS 15 after the placement of an external ventricular drain.
