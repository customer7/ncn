The **internal carotid artery** (**ICA**) is a branch of the [[Topics/Artery, Common Carotid\|common carotid artery]], it terminates into [[Topics/Artery, Middle Cerebral\|Artery, Middle Cerebral]] and [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|anterior cerebral artery]].

This [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] presents an interesting anatomical variation of the right ICA (<span style="color:magenta">magenta</span> arrow) terminus, which bifurcates into the inferior M1 (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow) and superior M1 (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow). The right [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|ACA]] (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow) originates from the superior M1. Alternatively, one may argue that the ICA terminates into an M1 (<span style="color:palegreen">green</span> arrow) and an A1 (<span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> arrow), while there is another M1 originating from the ICA trunk (<span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span> arrow).

P.S.: (B) and (C) originate from the same injection, whereas (A) features a slightly different angle.
