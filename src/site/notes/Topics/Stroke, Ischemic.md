## Cases

### 1

This patient presented with right hemiparesis and aphasia. A CTA revealed a left M2 occlusion. What this image shows is how collaterals came to the rescue. The patient subsequently underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy with TICI 2C reperfusion.

- <span style="color:pink">Pink</span> arrow: patent superior M2.
- <span style="color:teal">Teal</span> arrow: impeded flow in one of the branches of the inferior M2, suggesting distal occlusion.
- <span style="color:white">White</span> arrow: complete occlusion of one of the branches of the inferior M2.
- <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Blue</span> arrow: one collateral originating from the right ACA.
- <span style="color:palegreen">Green</span> arrow: another collateral originating from the right ACA.
- <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> arrow: a collateral from the PCA.
- <span style="color:red">Red</span> arrow: another collateral from the PCA.

This patient underwent [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] for the treatment of intracranial vasospasm. 

(**A**): Posterior circulation run showed collateral flow to an [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|ACA]] branch (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow).
(**B**): Left [[Topics/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] injection showed severe left [[Topics/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|A1]] (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> arrow) vasospasm, explaining the presentation seen in (A).
(**C**): This same ACA branch (<span style="color:red">red</span> arrow) could be faintly seen on the lateral run of the left ICA injection.
