This patient presented with an acute left M1 occlusion. Without cross-filling of the contralateral ACA through the [[Notes/Artery, Anterior Communicating\|ACOM]], this DSA presents a clear image of the left ACA and its branches (although not in the classic textbook manner).

2. [[Artery, Middle Cerebral\|MCA]] (occluded)
3. Medial lenticulostriate arteries
4. A1 (horizontal/pre-communicating segment)
5. A common branch of 6 and 7
6. Orbitofrontal artery
7. Frontopolar artery
8. A2 (vertical/post-communicating/infracallosal segment)
9. Callosomarginal artery (somewhat small)
10. Anteromedial frontal branches
11. A3 (precallosal segment)
12. Intermediomedial frontal branches
13. Posteromedial frontal and paracentral branches
14. A4 (supracallosal segment)
15. A5 (postcallosal segment)
