**Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1)** or **von Recklinghausen syndrome**, is a complex multi-system human disorder caused by the mutation of neurofibromin, a gene on chromosome 17 that is responsible for production of protein neurofibromin which is responsible for regulating the RAS-mediated cell growth signaling pathway. NF-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder. 

## Diagnosis
The NIH criteria^[[Neurofibromatosis type I - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I#Post-natal_testing)] - two of these seven "Cardinal Clinical Features" are required:
1. Six or more café-au-lait spots over 5 mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubertal individuals and over 15 mm in greatest diameter in post-pubertal individuals. Note that multiple café-au-lait spots alone are note a definitive diagnosis of NF-1 as these spots can e caused by a number of other conditions.
2. Two or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma
3. Freckling in axillary (Crowe sign) or inguinal regions
4. Optic nerve glioma
5. Two or more Lisch nodules (pigmented iris hamartomas)
6. A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia, or thinning of the long bone cortex with or without pseudarthrosis
7. A first degree relative (parent, sibling, or offspring) with NF-1 by the above criteria
