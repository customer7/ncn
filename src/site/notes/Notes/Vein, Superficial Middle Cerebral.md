The **superficial middle cerebral vein** (**SMCV**), AKA **Sylvian vein**, corses along the [[Fissure, Sylvian\|Sylvian fissure]] posteroanteriorly, curves around the tip of the [[Lobe, Temporal\|temporal lobe]], and drains into the [[Sinus, Sphenoparietal\|sphenoparietal sinus]] or [[Sinus, Cavernous\|cavernous sinus]].
