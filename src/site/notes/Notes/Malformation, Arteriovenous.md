In the acute phase of an AVM rupture, the lesion could be obscured by the adjacent hematoma. A repeat imaging study is usually necessary if the original workup was unremarkable ([[Notes/Malformation, Arteriovenous#1\|Case 1]]). In rare cases, an intracranial AVM could be supplied by both the [[Notes/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] and the [[Notes/Artery, External Carotid\|ECA]] ([[Notes/Malformation, Arteriovenous#2\|Case 2]]).

## Cases

### 1

This patient initially presented with a spontaneous posterior frontal IPH and the original DSA was negative (top row). A repeat DSA performed one year later revealed a small 13 mm AVM (bottom row), which was treated with intra-arterial Onyx embolization followed by craniotomy and resection.

### 2

This patient presented with a right parietal ICH and was found to have an AVM on CTA head. DSA showed a small right parietal AVM supplied by both right [[Notes/Artery, External Carotid\|ECA]]->[[Notes/Artery, Middle Meningeal\|MMA]] (**A** and **B**) and right [[Notes/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]]->[[Notes/Artery, Middle Cerebral\|MCA]] branches (**C** and **D**). Both feeders were subsequently embolized with Onyx, and the AVM was resected.
