## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/3q5beKU.jpg)
This patient presented with right hemiparesis and aphasia. A CTA revealed a left M2 occlusion. What this image shows is how collaterals came to the rescue. The patient subsequently underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy with TICI 2C reperfusion.

- Pink arrow: patent superior M2.
- Teal arrow: impeded flow in one of the branches of the inferior M2, suggesting distal occlusion.
- White arrow: complete occlusion of one of the branches of the inferior M2.
- Blue arrow: one collateral originating from the right ACA.
- Green arrow: another collateral originating from the right ACA.
- Yellow arrow: a collateral from the PCA.
- Red arrow: another collateral from the PCA.
