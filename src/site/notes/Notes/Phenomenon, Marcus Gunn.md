**Marcus Gunn phenomenon**, AKA **Marcus Gunn syndrome**/**Jaw-Winking syndrome**/**Marcus Gunn Ptosis**/**Maxillopalpebral [[Synkinesis\|Synkinesis]]**,  is a rare genetic disorder present at birth, characterized by movement of one upper eyelid in a rapid rising motion (open eyes) each time the jaw moves (contraction of ipsilateral lateral or medical pterygoid muscle).

- No gender preponderance
- Approximately 300 cases have been reported
- About 2%-13% of congenital ptosis
- Majority are unilateral, more often on the left
