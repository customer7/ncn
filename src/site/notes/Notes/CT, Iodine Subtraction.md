**Dual-energy CT** can be  for generating iodine subtraction imaging which is of tremendous utility in differentiating contrast vs blood.

## Cases

### One

Post-angiographic CT head of this patient showed diffuse high attenuation in the subarachnoid and intraventricular spaces, with uncertainty regarding contrast or blood. A repeat CT head in several hours would likely demonstrate the fading of the contrast. However, dual-energy CT head with iodine subtraction provides an instant answer.
