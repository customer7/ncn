**Spondylolisthesis** is the forward or anterior displacement of one vertebra over another. Backward displacement is referred to as **retrolisthesis**. Most common is L5 on S1, next most common is L4 on L5.

A [[Fracture, Hangman\|hangman's fracture]] is a specific type where the C2 is displaced anteriorly relative to C3 due to fracture of the C2's pedicles.

## Classification

### By Causes

- **Dysplastic/type 1**: congenital abnormalities of the upper sacral facets or inferior facets of L5. No pars defect. 94% are associated with spina bifida. Some of these may progress (no way to identify these).
- **Isthmic/spondylolytic/type 2**: defect in pars interarticularis or elongated pars (the neck of the "Scotty dog" on oblique LS-spine X-ray). May be seen in 5-20% of spine X-rays.
	- Lytic: fatigue fracture or insufficiency fracture of pars. In the pediatric age group may occur in athletes (especially gymnasts or football players); exacerbation of pre-existing defect v. repetitive trauma.
	- Elongated but intact pars: repetitive fractures and healing
	- Acute fracture of pars
- **Degenerative/type 3**: a result of facet arthritis and joint remodeling. More likely in women, persons older than fifty, and African Americans. Usually at L4-L5.
- **Traumatic/type 4**: acute fractures in the neural arch, other than pars.
- **Pathologic/type 5**: infection v. malignancy v. osteogenesis imperfecta
- **Iatrogenic/type 6**: surgical complication

### By Location

- A: pars fatigue fracture
- B: pars elongation due to multiple healed stress effects
- C: pars acute fracture

### By Severity

**Meyerding grading** of subluxation in the sagittal plane:
- Grade I: 0-25%
- Grade II: 25-50%
- Grade III: 50-75%
- Grade IV: 75-100%
- Grave V: \> 100%
