**Thoracic outlet syndrome**, AKA **TOS**, is a condition in which there is compression of the nerves, arteries, or veins in the superior thoracic aperture/outlet.

## Classification

### By Structures Affected

The compression can be isolated or involve two or more structures with various degrees.

#### Neurogenic (95%)

- Compression of the components of the brachial plexus nerves

#### Arterial (\< 1%)

- Compression of the subclavian artery

#### Venous (4%)

- Compression of the subclavian vein

### By Event

- Trauma
- Repetitive non-ergonomic postures
- Tumor
- Hyperostosis
- Osteomyelitis

### By Location

- Anterior scalene syndrome - compression on brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery by muscle growth
- Cervical rib - compression by rudimentary C7 rib
- Costoclavicular syndrome

## Management

### Surgery

#### Cervical Rib
- Brachial plexus exploration and decompression
