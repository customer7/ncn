How to safely perform femoral arterial access is the first step of any transfemoral angiography ([[Notes/Access, Femoral#1\|Case 1]]). Pre-interventional imaging such as CTA/MRA are sometimes of tremendous help, however, knowing the patient's anatomy remains a key step to avoid complications ([[Notes/Access, Femoral#2\|Case 2]], [[Notes/Access, Femoral#3\|Case 3]]).

Extensive atherosclerotic disease indicates a higher risk of stroke via transfemoral approach ([[Notes/Access, Femoral#4\|Case 4]]). According to the CREST study^[[Stenting versus Endarterectomy for Treatment of Carotid-Artery Stenosis | NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0912321?logout=true)], compared with carotid endarterectomy, stroke was more likely after transfemoral carotid-artery stenting. TCAR bypasses the aortic arch and subclavian/CCA origins, and is branded to have a lower peri-operative stroke rate.

## Cases

### 1

![](https://i.imgur.com/F6U3sLt.png)
This patient has a venous access catheter (black arrow) in the right common femoral vein, which travels towards the heart to the right of the spine. The arterial puncture site is lateral to this venous catheter, and the 0.021'' microwire (yellow arrowheads) from the micropuncture kit travels from the lateral side to the medial side of the venous catheter and then crosses the midline to the left of the spine, indicating arterial access. DSA showed that the arterial puncture site is in the common femoral artery, above the bifurcation (red double arrow).

### 2

This patient has a history of a renal transplant. The right common femoral artery run cleared depicted two kidneys in the vicinity. As this is a known history, caution should be taken when advancing the wire under fluoroscopy or even roadmap to avoid injury to either of the renal arteries.

### 3

This patient developed diffuse intracranial vasospasm in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm. A 6F 11 cm flexible Arrow sheath^[[Super Arrow-FlexÂ® Sheaths | US | Teleflex](https://www.teleflex.com/usa/en/product-areas/interventional/vascular-access-closure/super-arrow-flex-sheaths/)] was placed for repetitive intra-arterial vasodilation therapy, with its tip in the external iliac artery (yellow arrowhead). A severe stenotic segment (red arrow) was noticed at the CFA, impeding distal flow. Gentle withdrawal of the sheath under fluoroscopy until the tip was distal to the stenosis improved distal flow of the CFA, preventing distal limb ischemia. The left-in sheath was then sutured to the skin and maintained on continuous drip.

Extensive atherosclerotic changes are seen on this 3D reconstruction of CTA neck imaging, especially at the aortic arch and major arterial origins.
