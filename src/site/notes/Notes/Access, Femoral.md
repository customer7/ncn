Even though radial access has been gaining its popularity recently, femoral access remains the most widely used access for cerebral angiography. 

Pre-interventional imaging such as CTA/MRA are sometimes of tremendous help, however, knowing the patient's anatomy remains a key step to avoid complications.

## Cases

### One

This patient has a history of a renal transplant. The right common femoral artery run cleared depicted two kidneys in the vicinity. As this is a known history, caution should be taken when advancing the wire under fluoroscopy or even roadmap to avoid injury to either of the renal arteries.

### Two

This patient has a venous access catheter (black arrow) in the right common femoral vein, which travels towards the heart to the right of the spine. The arterial puncture site is lateral to this venous catheter, and the 0.021'' microwire (yellow arrowheads) from the micropuncture kit travels from the lateral side to the medial side of the venous catheter and then crosses the midline to the left of the spine, indicating arterial access. DSA showed that the arterial puncture site is in the common femoral artery, above the bifurcation (red double arrow).
