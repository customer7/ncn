The **RCVS<sub>2</sub>** score can be utilized to distinguish [[Syndrome, Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction\|reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome]] from other intracranial arteriopathies at admission.^[[RCVS2 score and diagnostic approach for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30635475/)]
