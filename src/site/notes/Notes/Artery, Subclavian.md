The right **subclavian artery**, AKA **lusorian artery**, usually shares a common origin with the right [[Notes/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]] as the brachiocephalic artery. However, it could originate directly from the aortic arch (see case presentation from [[Notes/Access, Radial Artery\|radial artery access]]-[[Notes/Access, Radial Artery#3\|Case 3]]).
