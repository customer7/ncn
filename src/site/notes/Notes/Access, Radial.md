## Tips and Tricks

### Medicine

- A small amount of local anesthetic is extremely useful in an awake patient to mitigate the pain caused by needle puncture and sheath placement
- Spasmolytic cocktail is typically composed of two vasodilators and heparin
	- 200-400 mcg of nitroglycerin
	- 2.5-5.0 mg of verapamil
	- 2,000 units of heparin
- Verapamil is acidic and will cause uncomfortable feeling, thus needs to be diluted before injecting
- Heparin dose can be adjusted depending on the purpose of the angiography

## Cases

A: Often times, there is an accompanying vein (red arrow) going along with the radial artery (yellow arrowhead). 
B: Gentle pressure on the wrist will collapse the vein while the artery remains full with pulsation. Notice the slight "upward shift" of the collapsed vein and the artery (closer to the skin).
