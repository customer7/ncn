## Cases

**Left VA Injection - PA**
![](https://i.imgur.com/PpjRJ3w.jpg)
There is a round hypodensity (arrow) that seems to be in the transverse segment of the left VA, worrisome for an air bubble. However, it did not travel forward as the run went on. Upon further examination, it represented the junction of the bilateral VBs and was caused by the dilution of the contrast due to the competitive flow from the right VA.
