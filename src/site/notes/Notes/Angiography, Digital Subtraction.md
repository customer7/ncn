## Cases

### 1

**Left VA Injection - PA**
![](https://i.imgur.com/libSuGb.png)
There is a round hypodensity (arrow) that seems to be in the transverse segment of the left VA, worrisome for an air bubble. However, it did not travel forward as the run went on. Upon further examination, it represented the junction of the bilateral VBs and was caused by the dilution of the contrast due to the competitive flow from the right VA.

(**A**): This patient presented with a supraclinoid aneurysm, which appears to be an isolated aneurysm without an adjacent branch.
(**B**): After flow diverter embolization, the stasis of the contrast revealed a small adjacent [[Artery, Superior Hypophyseal\|superior hypophyseal artery]] (yellow arrow).

- Red arrow: ophthalmic artery.

### 3

This patient underwent mechanical thrombectomy under moderate sedation for acute right ICA terminus occlusion. DSA images were blurred due to head motions (**A** and **C**). After **pixel shift** (**B** and **D**), the image quality significantly improved.

When selecting a target artery from the aortic arch, an LAO (**B**) view will provide better anatomy than a true PA view (**A**).
