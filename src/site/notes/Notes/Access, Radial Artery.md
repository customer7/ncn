With the introduction of various catheters designed for radial access, the **radial artery access** has been gaining popularity recently. The [[Notes/Catheter, Simmons\|Simmons catheters]] are typically the go-to choice for selecting target arteries.

## Tips and Tricks

### Medicine

- A small amount of local anesthetic is extremely useful in an awake patient to mitigate the pain caused by needle puncture and sheath placement
- Spasmolytic cocktail is typically composed of two vasodilators and heparin
	- 200-400 mcg of nitroglycerin
	- 2.5-5.0 mg of verapamil
	- 2,000 units of heparin
- Verapamil is acidic and will cause uncomfortable feeling, thus needs to be diluted before injecting
- Heparin dose can be adjusted depending on the purpose of the angiography

### Avoiding Complications

- When injecting the anesthetics, make sure all the air in the syringe is purged out, as subcutaneous air could severely interfere with the ultrasound imaging and obscure the artery.
- When injecting a spasmolytic cocktail into an awake patient, make sure to inform the patient and hold the patient's arm in place to prevent sudden movement of the arm due to discomfort.

## Cases

### 1

**Ultrasound-Guided Radial Artery Puncture**

**A**: Frequently, there is an accompanying vein (red arrow) running alongside the radial artery (yellow arrowhead). 
**B**: Applying gentle pressure on the wrist will cause the vein to collapse, while the artery remains full with pulsations. Observe the slight "upward shift" of both the collapsed vein and the artery (closer to the skin).

The local anesthetic (white diamond) can be seen above the right radial artery (red star).

### 3

**CTA Neck**
![](https://i.imgur.com/CVxdMX9.jpg)
The **aberrant right subclavian artery**/**lusorian artery** (red arrow) which can be easily ascertained on CTA neck, is considered a relative contraindication for radial access.^[[Radial Access via Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery | neuroangio.org](https://neuroangio.org/sample-page/case-archives/radial-access-via-aberrant-right-subclavian-artery/)] Yellow arrow: right CCA. Blue arrow: left CCA. Green arrow: left subclavian artery. Orange arrow: right VA. Pink star: esophagus. White diamond: trachea. (Unfortunately, this is not an ideal study due to the suboptimal timing and contrast contamination in the adjacent veins.)

**CTA Chest**

This patient presented after a chest trauma. There is also an aberrant right subclavian artery (red arrow). Also, please note the right pulmonary contusion and the chest tube.

- Yellow arrow: Right [[Notes/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- Blue arrow: Left [[Notes/Artery, Common Carotid\|CCA]]. 
- Green arrow: Left subclavian artery. 
- Orange arrow: Right [[Notes/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- Cyan arrow: Left [[Notes/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]]. 
- Black arrow: Right long thoracic artery. 
- Magenta star: Esophagus/NGT. 
- White diamond: Trachea/ETT.

This angiography revealed a tortuous right radial artery origin with adjacent two U-turns. The Glidewire was too stiff to safely navigate through these two turns (red arrow). Consequently, the decision was made to abandon radial access and switch to a femoral access. In cases where the right radial artery remains the only viable option for access, one could consider using a microwire to guide the selection of the brachial artery, followed by a microcatheter to straighten the radial artery origin. 

- Orange arrow: The tip of the sheath.
- White arrow: Radial artery.
- Blue arrow: Ulnar artery.
- Green arrow: Brachial artery.

The right [[Notes/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] (pink arrow) is typically the first artery to catheterize in diagnostic cerebral angiography via the radial access.

(**A**): In this pre-operative CTA neck 3D reconstruction view, the right VA origin (green arrow) can be clearly recognized with its relative location to the tip of the distal right subclavian curve (white arrow).
(**B**): Advance the catheter tip (orange arrow) to the estimated VA origin and obtain a roadmap to assist in artery catheterization.

An alternative method to localize the right VA origin would be to advance the catheter tip more distally and then retract it while puffing contrast to opacify it.
