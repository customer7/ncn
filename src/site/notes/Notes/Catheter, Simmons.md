The **Simmons catheter** is a group of reverse-curve selective catheters widely used in the [[Notes/Access, Radial Artery\|radial access]] approach for selecting target arteries. In most cases, the catheter must be shaped into its intended configuration ([[Notes/Catheter, Simmons#1\|Case 1]], [[Notes/Catheter, Simmons#2\|Case 2]], [[Notes/Catheter, Simmons#3\|Case 3]]) before it can be used to select the target artery. The catheter features three curves.^[[Simmons catheter | Radiology Reference Article | Radiopaedia.org](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/simmons-catheter?lang=us)]

## Cases

### 1

Via [[Notes/Access, Radial Artery\|radial artery access]], the traditional way to shape the Simmons 2 catheter involves using the aortic arch. 

(**A**): The Glidewire (black arrow) is advanced into the descending aorta, along with the tip of the Simmons catheter (orange arrow). 
(**B**): The Glidewire is withdrawn proximal to the secondary curve (red arrow). 
(**C** and **D**): The catheter is slightly twisted and pushed so that the secondary curve herniates down into the ascending aorta. 
(**E**): The catheter is successfully shaped with its tip at the aortic arch-descending aorta junction, the secondary curve in the ascending aorta, and tertiary curve (cyan arrow) in the brachiocephalic artery. 

- Blue arrow: primary curve.

In situations where the Glidewire fails to enter the aortic arch, the following technique could be attempted.

(**A**): Advance the Glidewire (black arrow) into the ascending aorta.
(**B**): Advance the catheter tip (orange arrow) into the ascending aorta. 
(**C**): Withdraw the Glidewire into the catheter proximal to the primary curve (blue arrow) and point the catheter tip leftward.
(**D**): Slowly withdraw the catheter until its tip "pops" into the aortic arch.
(**E**): Gently advance the Glidewire into the descending aorta.
(**F**): Advance the catheter tip into the descending aorta.

Every once in a while, luck strikes, and the Glidewire goes directly into the left CCA, simplifying the forming process.

(**A**): In this particular case, the Glidewire (black arrow indicates its tip) entered the left CCA directly. 
(**B**): The Simmons catheter followed the Glidewire's path with a gentle advancement while the latter was firmly held (tip out of the view on this PA imagine). 
(**C**) The formation was completed with a slow withdrawal of the Glidewire. 

- Orange arrow: Catheter tip. 
- Blue arrow: primary curve. 
- Red arrow: reversed secondary curve (the knee). 
- Cyan arrow: tertiary curve.

This patient presents for a diagnostic cerebral angiography for a left temporal [[Notes/Malformation, Arteriovenous\|AVM]]. In this particular case, the distance of the left [[Notes/Artery, Vertebral\|VA]] origin to the aortic arch is within the length limit of the Simmons 2 catheter distal to the secondary curve (red arrow), simplifying the selection process.

(**A**): The catheter tip (orange arrow) appears to be positioned within the left [[Notes/Artery, Subclavian\|subclavian artery]] on contrast puff.
(**B**): The roadmap confirms its position, which is proximal to the origin of the left VA (white arrow).
(**C**): A gentle pull on the catheter will advance the catheter tip to engage the left VA.
(**D**): A contrast puff confirms the successful selection of the left VA.

- Blue arrow: primary curve.
- Green arrow: left thyrocervical trunk.
- Magenta arrow: left subclavian artery.
