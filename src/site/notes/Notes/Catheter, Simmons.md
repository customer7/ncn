The **Simmons catheter** is a group of reverse-curve selective catheters widely used in the [[Notes/Access, Radial\|radial access]] approach for selecting target arteries. In most cases, the catheter must be shaped into its intended configuration ([[Notes/Catheter, Simmons#1\|Case 1]], [[Notes/Catheter, Simmons#2\|Case 2]]) before it can be used to select the target artery. The catheter features three curves.^[[Simmons catheter | Radiology Reference Article | Radiopaedia.org](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/simmons-catheter?lang=us)]

## Cases

### 1

The traditional way to shape the Simmons catheter involves using the aortic arch.

(**A**): The Glidewire (black arrow) is advanced into the descending aorta, along with the tip of the Simmons catheter (yellow arrow). 
(**B**): The Glidewire is withdrawn proximal to the secondary curve (red arrow). 
(**C** and **D**): The catheter is slightly twisted and pushed so that the secondary curve herniates down into the ascending aorta. 
(**E**): The catheter is successfully shaped with its tip at the aortic arch-descending aorta junction, the secondary curve in the ascending aorta, and tertiary curve (teal arrow) in the brachiocephalic artery. 

Blue arrow: primary curve.

### 2

Every once in a while, luck strikes, and the Glidewire goes directly into the left CCA, simplifying the forming process.

(**A**): In this particular case, the Glidewire (black arrow indicates its tip) entered the left CCA directly. 
(**B**): The Simmons catheter followed the Glidewire's path with a gentle advancement while the latter was firmly held (tip out of the view on this PA imagine). 
(**C**) The formation was completed with a slow withdrawal of the Glidewire. 

Yellow arrow: Catheter tip. 
Blue arrow: primary curve. 
Red arrow: reversed secondary curve (the knee). 
Teal arrow: tertiary curve.
