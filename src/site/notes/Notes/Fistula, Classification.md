### Borden Classification of Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas
{ #8a4eff}


- Type I: antegrade drainage into the dural sinus/meningeal vein - benign
- Type II: antegrade drainage into dural sinus and retrograde drainage into cortical veins
- Type III - isolated retrograde drainage:
{ #cf1ad9}

	- Drains directly into cortical veins
	- Trapped segment of sinus with reflux into cortical veins
	- Venous varix/dural lake with reflux into cortical veins

### Cognard Classification of Cerebral Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas
{ #b5d1ce}


- Type I: normal antegrade flow into a dural venous sinus; benign
- Type II
	- Type IIa: drainage into a sinus with retrograde flow within the sinus; sinus reflex caused IC-HTN in 20%
	- Type IIb: antegrade drainage into a sinus with retrograde flow into cortex veins; reflux into veins induced hemorrhage in 10%
	- Type IIa+b: drainage into a sinus with retrograde flow within the sinus and cortical veins; aggressive in 66% with bleeding and/or IC-HTN
- Type III: direct drainage into a cortical vein without venous ectasia*; hemorrhage in 40%
- Type IV: direct drainage into a cortical vein with venous ectasia; hemorrhage in 65%
{ #47c631}

- Type V: direct drainage into spinal perimedullary veins in addition to all of the above; progressive myelopathy in 50%
- \* Diameter greater than 5 mm or 3x larger than diameter of draining vein

## Carotid-Cavernous 
### Barrow Classification of Carotid-Cavernous Fistulas
{ #f4b429}


- Type A (direct): high-flow shunts between ICA and CS
- Type B (indirect): meningeal branch of ICA to CS
- Type C (indirect): meningeal branch of ECA to CS
- Type D (indirect): meningeal branch of both ICA and ECA to CS
