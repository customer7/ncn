This [[Notes/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] presents an interesting anatomical variation of the right ICA (magenta arrow) terminus, which bifurcates into the inferior M1 (blue arrow) and superior M1 (green arrow). The right [[Notes/Artery, Anterior Cerebral\|ACA]] (yellow arrow) originates from the superior M1. Alternatively, one may argue that the ICA terminates into an M1 (green arrow) and A1 (yellow arrow), while there is another M1 originating from the ICA trunk (blue arrow).

Cyan arrow: [[Notes/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|Posterior communicating artery]]/[[Notes/Artery, Posterior Cerebral\|posterior cerebral artery]].
White arrow: Callosomarginal artery.
Brown arrow: Pericallosal artery.

P.S.: (B) and (C) originate from the same injection, whereas (A) features a slightly different angle.
