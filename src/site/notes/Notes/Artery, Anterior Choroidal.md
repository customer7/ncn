The **anterior choroidal artery** originates from the [[Notes/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]], distal to the [[Notes/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]]. The *plexal point* marks where it enters the lateral ventricle.^[[Anterior choroidal artery | Radiology Reference Article | Radiopaedia.org](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/anterior-choroidal-artery)]

On this right ICA injection, from proximal to distal, the [[Notes/Artery, Ophthalmic\|ophthalmic artery]] (blue arrow), the [[Notes/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] (green arrow), and the AChA originate from the intracranial [[Notes/Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] (**A**). The AChA can be clearly discerned along its course both on the PA (**A**) and lateral (**B** and **C**) views. After making the turn at the plexal point (white arrow), the AChA enters the right lateral ventricle to supply the [[Notes/Plexus, Choroid\|choroid plexus]] (red arrow). What seems to be a [[Notes/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] origin aneurysm vs. infundibulum on the lateral views is actually the [[Notes/Artery, Posterior Communicating\|PCOM]] itself making a turn (**D**).
