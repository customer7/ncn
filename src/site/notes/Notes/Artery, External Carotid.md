The **external carotid artery** (**ECA**) is one of the two branches of the [[Artery, Common Carotid\|common carotid artery]]. It supplies the face and neck.

## Cases

### One

**CTA 3D Reconstruction**

There is no ECA originating from the right CCA.

**DSA - Right CCA Injection (PA and Lateral)**

It seems there is an anastomosis between the cavernous segment of the right [[Artery, Internal Carotid\|ICA]] and the right [[Artery, Maxillary\|internal maxillary artery]] (yellow arrow).

#### Comments

- The absence of the right ECA could be due to congenital vs complete occlusion as a result of severe atherosclerotic disease.
