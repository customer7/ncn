Originating in the early 19th century, "**Fenestra**," a Latin word for "window," is used to describe a hole in an anatomical structure.^[[Fenestra - Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780195392883.001.0001/m_en_us1246648?rskey=Z7D9Eg&result=1)]^[[Fenestra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenestra)] Its derivative, "**fenestration**," meaning the surgical creation of such an opening, has, however, been more widely used to describe a natural luminal separation in an artery.

This patient presented with diffuse Fisher grade 4 SAH. The outside hospital's CTA reported left V4 dissection vs. aneurysm (though of poor quality). However, a repeat CTA at our institute suggested a fenestration (**A**). Vessel wall MRI also showed no significant contrast enhancement (**B**, **C**).

Diagnostic cerebral angiography confirmed a left V4 fenestration (**D**, **E**). No cause of the hemorrhage was found, suggesting perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. (**F**): right PICA and left AICA are dominant.
