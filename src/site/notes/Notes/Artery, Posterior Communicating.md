The **posterior communicating artery**, AKA **PCOM artery**, connects the [[Artery, Internal Carotid\|internal carotid artery]] with the [[Artery, Posterior Cerebral\|posterior cerebral artery]]. It is called fetal PCOM artery if it is bigger than the first segment (P1) of the PCA.

This patient has a left fetal PCOM artery (yellow arrow) supplying the left PCA (blue arrow) and absence of the left P1. On the right VA injection, the right PCOM (green arrow) can be discerned with a perforator (black arrow) heading up to the right thalamus. There is also a duplicate left SCA (red arrow). By the way, did you see the hidden aneurysm? :)
