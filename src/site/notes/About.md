Inspired by websites [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.41610.org), [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/), [Neuroangio](http://neuroangio.org/), and [HeadNeckBrainSpine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126042547/http://headneckbrainspine.com/) etc., we aspire to create one based on [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and plug-in [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). Here, we share interesting neurosurgery cases.
