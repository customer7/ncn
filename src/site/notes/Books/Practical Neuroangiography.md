The Third Edition provides the new fellow with the background knowledge needed to understand these procedures, the unusual variant anatomy that can affect treatment and outcomes, and the field’s current limitations. Organized for ease of use, the book's four sections address techniques and safety; normal anatomy & pathology correlated with angiographic images; angiographic findings of neurovascular diseases; and an introduction to interventional techniques and emergency procedures. Actual patient cases provide practical stepwise coverage of each procedure, tips for accurate diagnosis, and guidance in clinical decision-making.
