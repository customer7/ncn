The **rotational vertebral artery syndrome**, AKA **Bow Hunter's syndrome**, is a type of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in which rotating the neck would cause [[Topics/Artery, Vertebral\|vertebral artery]] occlusion.

## Cases

### 1 Asymptomatic Rotational Vertebral Artery Occlusion

This patient presented for a [[Topics/Angiography, Digital Subtraction\|DSA]] for some other reason and was incidentally found to have a right VA occlusion when rotating the head to the right side (**A**). Please note the disruption of the antegrade flow and reflux of the contrast into the right [[Topics/Artery, Subclavian\|subclavian artery]]. After turning the head to the left side (**B**), the occlusion of the right VA resolved.
