## H&P

- 51F, right-hand dominant
- PMHx: arrhythmia, asthma, antiphospholipid syndrome, migraines
- SoHx: former smoker of cigarettes, denies EtOH/drugs
- HPI: 
	- Presented to neurosurgery clinic
	- Progressive left neck and posterior shoulder pain for years
	- Now radiating to left palm with numbness and tingling
	- Left hand weakness
	- Denies gait changes or incontinence of bowel/bladder
- PE: 
	- LUE grossly 4/5
	- +b/l Hoffman's
	- -clonus
	- Decreased sensation to light touch on LUE (medial 2.5 fingers)
	- Tenderness on left paraspinous/trapezius
- Workup: 
	- Cervical spine MRI without contrast
	- Neck X-ray
	- Cervical spine CT
	- Nerve conduction study:
		- Grossly normal except minimal decrease of left ulnar motor amplitude at wrist which does not match exactly with cubital tunnel syndrome
		- No electrophysiological evidence of entrapment neuropathy, left cervical radiculopathy, large fiber polyneuropathy or myopathy
	- EMG
		- Mild left ulnar neuropathy at the elbow
		- Mild median mononeuropathy in the right wrist seen in carpal tunnel syndrome
		- No electrodiagnostic evidence of left cervical radiculopathy

## Differential Diagnosis

- [[Notes/Syndrome, Thoracic Outlet\|Thoracic outlet syndrome]] - neurogenic, secondary to cervical rib
- Cervical radiculopathy - symptoms do not correlate with certain dermatomes
- Peripheral neuropathy - ruled out by NCS and EMG

---

## Surgical Intervention

- Intraoperative neuro-monitoring with nerve stimulation
- Supine
- Left shoulder roll
- Rightward head turn
- Posterior cervical triangle
- Incision along the posterior border of left SCM
- Dissection of platysma muscle
- Dissection of anterior scalene fat pad
- Identification of phrenic nerve on the anterior scalene muscle
- Identification and decompression of upper, middle, and lower trunks
- Identification and resection of cervical rib
- Closure

## Intra-Op Imaging

A vessel loop was used to isolate the upper, middle, and lower trunks, respectively.

## Intra-Op X-ray

From left to right: a clamp was used to identify the cervical rig; the tip of the Penfield No. 4 was at the costovertebral junction of C7; after the resection of the cervical rib.

## Post-Op Recovery

- Chest X-ray in PACU to rule out pneumothorax and phrenic nerve injury
- Floor care withe very 4 hours neuro-checks
- Sling for comfort
- Medical 2.5 fingers numbness improved
- New left lateral 3 fingers tingling
