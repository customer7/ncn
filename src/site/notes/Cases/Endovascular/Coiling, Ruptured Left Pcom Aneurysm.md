## Post-Operative Course

- No new neurological deficits
- Continued Nimodipine and Keppra
- Left ptosis improved on postoperative day (POD) 1
- Anisocoria persisted
- Transferred to floor on POD6
- Discharged on POD10

---

## Follow-Up Plan

-  #todo 3-4 months with MRA brain

---

## Discussion

- Ptosis improved thanks to the amelioration of the pulsatile compression from the aneurysm on the CN III.
- The parasympathetic fibers are at periphery which is first injured by the mechanical compression from the aneurysm -> persistent anisocoria.
- Flow diverter is another option, however, not ideal considering the patient's recent rupture of the aneurysm.
