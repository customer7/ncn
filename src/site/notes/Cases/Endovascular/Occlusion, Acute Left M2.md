## Discussion

- Occlusion was distal to the origin of [[Cases/Endovascular/Occlusion, Acute Left M2#^34dc73\|anterior temporal artery]]
- Good collateral supply from left ACA - [[Cases/Endovascular/Occlusion, Acute Left M2#^b9a0c2\|small core, large penumbra]]
- Atresic/hypoplastic right A1 on [[Cases/Endovascular/Occlusion, Acute Left M2#^7cc496\|CTA]]
