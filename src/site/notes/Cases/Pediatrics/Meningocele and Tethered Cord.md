The conus terminalis was tethered by a fatty filum and terminates at the upper L4 level.

There is no hydrocephalus or Chiari malformation on the brain MRI.

---

## Differential Diagnosis

- 2-3 cm simple meningocele without accompanying hydrocephalus or Chiari malformation
- Fatty filum with tethered spinal cord
- Myelomeningocele

---

## Surgical Intervention

- Intraoperative neuro-monitoring
- Prone
- Head on a donut
- Vertical incision, ellipsing out the meningocele
-  Dissection around the meningocele
- Circumferential freeing of the arachnoid
- Creation of dural plane 
- Identification of fatty filum
- Stimulation of fatty filum without response at 3 mA
- Cauterization of fatty filum at above and below, 15 mm apart
- Removal of fatty filum and sent for permanent pathology
- Retraction of the cephalad end of the fatty filum superiorly (out of view)
- Closure of dura (4-0 Nurolon) - watertight, no leak on Valsalva
- Closure of muscle layer (3-0 Vicryl)
- Closure of skin (4-0 Vicryl Rapide)
