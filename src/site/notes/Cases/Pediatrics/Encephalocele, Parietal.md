	- Expands when cries
	- No drainage

## Imaging

---

CT head without contrast - Axial, coronal, and sagittal

CT head with contrast - Axial, coronal, and sagittal
![](https://i.imgur.com/WA31IBw.png)
- A vertically oriented primitive [[Notes/Sinus, Falcine\|falcine sinus]] extends from the posterior internal cerebral veins to the site of the calvarial defect. 
- The straight sinus is relatively hypoplastic.

## Diagnosis

- Parietal encephalocele

---

## Surgical Repair

- Prone
- Fish-mouth style incision from just to the left of midline to the right
- Dissection down to skull
- Identification of bony defect and the stalk
- Skeletonization of the stalk
- Occlusion with a 2-0 silk tie
- Resection of the cutaneous portion
- Circumferential dissection of the bony defect
- Coverage of defect using the bone harvested lateral to the defect (secured with 3-0 Vicryl)
- Surgicel coverage
- Closure
- Pathology: pending

---

## Post-Op Recovery

- ICU with hourly neuro-checks overnight
- No deficits
- TTF on POD1
- Discharged home

---

## Discussion

- The lesion is at the proximity of the superior sagittal sinus and seems to have connection with the falcine sinus, posing a high risk of intraoperative vascular injury.
