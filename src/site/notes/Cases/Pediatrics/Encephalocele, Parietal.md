## H&P

- HPI: 
	- Presented to clinic
	- Born with a 2-3 cm slightly right biased parietal skull/scalp mass
	- Expands when cries
	- No drainage
- PE: 
	- Alert, appears stated age and cooperative
	- 2-3 cm right biased parietal scalp/skull mass, with thinned area of alopecia overlying
	- No palpable bony defect
	- No pulsatility
	- Anterior fontanelle soft and flat
	- Normal strength and tone, symmetric reflexes
	- Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact
- Workup: CT head without contrast

CT Head with Contrast - Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal

- A vertically oriented primitive [[Topics/Sinus, Falcine\|falcine sinus]] extends from the posterior internal cerebral veins to the site of the calvarial defect. 
- The straight sinus is relatively hypoplastic.

## Diagnosis

- Parietal encephalocele

---

## Surgical Repair

- Prone
- Fish-mouth style incision from just to the left of midline to the right
- Dissection down to skull
- Identification of bony defect and the stalk
- Skeletonization of the stalk
- Occlusion with a 2-0 silk tie
- Resection of the cutaneous portion
- Circumferential dissection of the bony defect
- Coverage of defect using the bone harvested lateral to the defect (secured with 3-0 Vicryl)
- Surgicel coverage
- Closure
- Pathology: skin tissue with no significant pathological findings, consistent with clinical diagnosis of encephalocele.

---

## Post-Op Recovery

- ICU with hourly neuro-checks overnight
- No deficits
- TTF on POD1
- Discharged home

---

## Discussion

- The lesion is at the proximity of the superior sagittal sinus and seems to have connection with the falcine sinus, posing a high risk of intraoperative vascular injury.
