#NF1 #tumor/lsp #PNS

## H&P

- 43M
- PMHx: [[Notes/Neurofibromatosis, Type I\|NF-1]]
- PSHx: right AKA for osteomyelitis (non-healing femur fracture s/p ORIF)
- FHx: skin lesions on father's side
- HPI: back pain radiating down RLE to the stump x7m
- PE: GCS 15, full strength, RLE amputated at hip, 1+ reflexes, stable walking with crutches
- Workup: pelvic and lumbar spine MRI with and without contrast, PET CT

---

## Imaging

---

Pelvic MRI without contrast - Axial T1WI, axial T2WI, coronal T1WI, coronal T2WI

Pelvic MRI T1WI with contrast - Axial and coronal
![](https://i.imgur.com/jW7ZCzD.png)
Enhancing right L3-4 and L5-S1 paraspinal lesions consistent with neurofibromas with slight extension into the distal neural foramen but no significant extension into the spinal canal. 

---

PET CT
![](https://i.imgur.com/JZCswGw.png)
- 42 mCi F-18 FDG IV
- Mildly hypermetabolic well-circumscribed low density right paraspinal mass measuring 7.3 x 6.8 cm most suggestive of a neurogenic tumor, likely neurofibroma given patient's clinical history.

---

## Differential Diagnosis

- Benign
    -   Neuroma
    -   Neurofibroma
    -   Schwannoma
    -   Perineurioma
-   Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors

---

## Surgical Intervention

- Approach: anterior trans-abdominal
- Multidisciplinary operation
	- Vascular surgery - exposure and closure
	- Neurosurgery - tumor resection
- - Forwent intraoperative neuro-monitoring due to patient's right AKA

---

## Intra-Operative Imaging

---

Supine position with lower thoracic and abdominal areas exposed. 
NB: notice the neurofibromas and caf√©-au-lait spots.

A right curvilinear incision was proposed and marked.

The tumor was exposed with several nerves draping over the capsule.

Intraoperative frozen: nerve sheath tumor.

Tumor capsule was preserved, as well as the nerves attached to it.

The wound was closed with Dermabond.

---

## Post-Op Course

- Recovered well neurologically
- Presurgical back pain resolved
- Resolved back and radiating pain
- Anemia required RBC transfusion
- Urinary retention required replacement of Foley
- Pathology
	- Frozen: favored schwannoma
	- Permanent: nerve sheath tumor, benign
		- +S-100
		- +CD34
		- -calretinin
		- Antoni A and B

## Discussion

#### Schwannoma Resection Techniques^[[A precise excision technique for schwannomas - European Journal of Plastic Surgery](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00238-012-0715-1)]^[[Surgical strategies for peripheral nerve schwannoma based on the intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468900919300386)]

- Intraoperative monitoring
- Grows extrinsic to its parent fascicles
- Well-defined capsule - perineurium and nerve bundles
- Enucleation
