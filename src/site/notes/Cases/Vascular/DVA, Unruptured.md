- PSHx: DSA at OSH
- FHx: drug abuse (father), birth defects (son)
- SoHx: daily smoker (1 PPD), +EtOH, denies drugs

## Imaging

---

CT head w/o Contrast - Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal
![](https://i.imgur.com/sZ8IL53.png)
Left medial frontal lobe hypodensity, corresponding to the history of ICH 2 weeks ago.

---

Brain MRI - DWI/ADC/FLAIR/SWI 
![](https://i.imgur.com/0l5wO3g.png)

---

Brain MRI - T1WI, T2WI, T1WI w/ Contrast

---

Brain MRI - T2WI, T1WI w/ Contrast, SWI
![](https://i.imgur.com/tiM3Sxo.png)
A developmental venous anomaly is seen at the interhemispheric location, adjacent to the genu of the corpus callosum.

---

Serial axial T2WI 
![](https://i.imgur.com/kQUXGE4.png)
The DVA appears to drain inferiorly into the internal cerebral vein.

---

## Diagnostic Cerebral Angiography

- Access: right common femoral artery
- 5F 10 cm sheath
- 4F 100 cm Glidecath
- 0.035‘’ 180 cm Glidewire

---

DSA - Left ICA, PA and Lateral

---

DSA - Left ECA, PA and Lateral

---

Brain MRI and DSA (Right ICA Injection) - T2WI, PA (Late Arterial Phase, Early Venous Phase, and Late Venous Phase)

---

## Interpretation of the DSA

- No vascular lesion is identified to explain the medial left frontal lobe hemorrhage
- RCVS remains a possible diagnosis
- The DVA can be seen in the venous phase
