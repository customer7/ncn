## H&P

- 24F
- PMHx: asthma, anxiety, ICH at OSH 2w ago (admitted for 11d)
- PSHx: DSA at OSH
- FHx: drug abuse (father), birth defects (son)
- SoHx: daily smoker (1 PPD), +EtOH, denies drugs
- HPI: 
	- Presented to ED
	- Headache and photophobia
- PE: GCS 15, no gross deficits
- Workup: CT head w/o contrast, brain MRI with and without contrast

---

## Imaging

---

CT Head without Contrast - Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal
![](https://i.imgur.com/sZ8IL53.png)
Left medial frontal lobe hypodensity, corresponding to the history of ICH 2 weeks ago.

---

Brain MRI - DWI/ADC/FLAIR/SWI 
![](https://i.imgur.com/0l5wO3g.png)

---

Brain MRI - T1WI, T2WI, T1WI with Contrast

Brain MRI - T2WI, T1WI with Contrast, SWI
![](https://i.imgur.com/tiM3Sxo.png)
A developmental venous anomaly is seen at the interhemispheric location, adjacent to the genu of the corpus callosum.

---

Serial Axial T2WI

The DVA appears to drain inferiorly into the internal cerebral vein.

## Diagnostic Cerebral Angiography

- Access: right common femoral artery
- 5F 10 cm sheath
- 4F 100 cm Glidecath
- 0.035‘’ 180 cm Glidewire

---

DSA - Left ICA, PA and Lateral

---

DSA - Left ECA, PA and Lateral

---

Brain MRI and DSA (Right ICA Injection) - T2WI, PA (Late Arterial Phase, Early Venous Phase, and Late Venous Phase)

---

## Interpretation of the DSA

- No vascular lesion is identified to explain the medial left frontal lobe hemorrhage
- The DVA can be seen in the venous phase

---

## Discussion

- [[Notes/Anomaly, Developmental Venous\|Developmental venous anomaly]]
- [[Notes/Score, RCVS2\|RCVS]] remains a possible cause of the ICH
- [ ] #todo Repeat brain MRI with and without contrast in 3 months
