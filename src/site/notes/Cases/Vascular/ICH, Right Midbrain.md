## Follow-Up Clinic (2.5 months)

- Stopped lisdexamfetamine
- Left facial anesthesia resolved
- Horizontal diplopia resolved
- Vertical diplopia persisted
- Otherwise no deficits
- PE: PERRLA, EOMI, CN II-XII intact
-  #todo Follow up brain MRI with and without contrast in 6 months

## Discussion

- Most likely diagnosis is hypertensive IPH due to the side effect of lisdexamfetamine
- No evidence of cavernous malformation on brain MRI
