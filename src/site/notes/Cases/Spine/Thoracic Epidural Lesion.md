## Post-Operative Course

- Recovered well from surgery
- No new neurological deficits
- ICU observation overnight
- Transferred to floor on POD1
- Persisted clonus and hyper-reflexia on BLE
- Clonus resolved on POD2
- Physical therapy: inpatient rehabilitation with 3 or more hours of skilled therapy per day
- Pathology report: extraosseous [[Cyst, Aneurysmal Bone\|aneurysmal bone cyst]]

---

## Clinic Follow-Up (3 Weeks)

- Symptoms all improved
- Wound well-healed
- BLE spasticity, hyper-reflexia improved
- Normal gait
- #todo 3 months post-op follow-up thoracic MRI

---

## Discussion

- Pre-op MRI indicated an epidural lesion
- Rib numbers were carefully counted before OR for precise localization
- Optional intraoperative neuro-monitoring
