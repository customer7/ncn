## Imaging

---

CT Head without Contrast
![](https://i.imgur.com/OAgwaQU.png)
There is a large interhemispheric cystic lesion without calcification, more to the right.

Brain MRI without Contrast - DWI/ADC/FLAIR/GRE

---

Brain MRI - DWI
![](https://i.imgur.com/nFryY5K.png)
This tumor presents restricted diffusion on DWI sequences.

---

Brain MRI - Axial T2WI

The T2 signal does not follow CSF signal.

---

Brain MRI - Coronal T2WI

---

Brain MRI - T1WI, T2WI, T1WI w/ Contrast, T1WI w/ Contrast
![](https://i.imgur.com/uB6OCPR.jpg)
There is no contrast enhancement of the tumor.

---

CTA Head - Thick Coronal

Bilateral ACAs are displaced laterally due to the mass effect of the tumor.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Epidermoid cyst
- Dermoid cyst
- Craniopharyngioma
- Neurenteric cyst
- Arachnoid cyst

---

## Surgical Intervention

- BrainLab intraoperative navigation
- Supine
- Head neutral in Mayfield holder
- Elevated for about 15Â° 
- Bicoronal incision
- Bifrontal craniotomy, more to the right
- U-shape dural incision, based along the superior sagittal sinus
- Interhemispheric dissection between the falx and the right frontal lobe
- Separation of the tumor capsule from surrounding tissues
- Debulking of the tumor with CUSA (mainly fatty tissues)
- Left some capsule stuck to the normal brain
- Copious irrigation
- Hemostasis
- Dural closure
- Bone flap 
- Scalp closure

---

## Post-Op Course

- ICU for hourly neuro-checks overnight
- No new neurological deficits
- Transferred to regular floor on POD1
- Discharged home on POD2
- Pathology
	- Epidermoid cyst
	- CD68: Focally positive  
	- GFAP: Focally positive

## Post-Op MRI

Brain MRI - Axial DWI

There was a near total resection with some cavity border ischemic changes.
