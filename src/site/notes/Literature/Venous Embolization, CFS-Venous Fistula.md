## A Novel Endovascular Therapy for CSF Hypotension Secondary to CSF-Venous Fistulas - AJNR

In this paper[^1], the authors reported a consecutive case series of five patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension secondary to [[Notes/Fistula, CSF-Venous\|CSF-venous fistula]], which was successfully treated with endovascular transvenous Onyx embolization.

### Reference Points

- All the fistulas were localized using digital subtraction myelogram (DSM)
- Build a plug with 0.5 mL of Onyx 34, then embolize the fistula using 1 mL of Onyx 18
- Other treatment options: laminectomy, facetectomy, and ligation of the nerve root and associated veins.
