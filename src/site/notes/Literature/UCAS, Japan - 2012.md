## The Natural Course of Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysms in a Japanese Cohort | NEJM

In this paper^[[The Natural Course of Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysms in a Japanese Cohort | NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1113260)], the authors enrolled newly identified, unruptured saccular cerebral aneurysms of 3 mm or more in patients aged 20 years or older in Japan from January 2001 to April 2004. They concluded that the natural course of unruptured cerebral aneurysms varies according to the size, location, and shape of the aneurysm.

### Reference Points

- The old patients had larger aneurysms.
- The risk of rupture was significantly increased for all aneurysms that were *7 mm* or larger.
- In patients with multiple aneurysms, each aneurysm is not associated with an increased risk of rupture.
- Thrombosed or calcified aneurysms were often large and had an increased tendency to rupture (small number of cases).
- The overall rate of rupture of cerebral aneurysms was *0.95%* annually.
- A history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, former or current smoking, the presence of multiple aneurysms, and hypertension, did not significantly affect the risk of rupture in this cohort.
