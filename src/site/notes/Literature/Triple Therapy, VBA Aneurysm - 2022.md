## Triple Therapy versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy for Dolichoectatic Vertebrobasilar Fusiform Aneurysms Treated with Flow Diverters | Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery

In this paper^[[Triple therapy versus dual-antiplatelet therapy for dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysms treated with flow diverters | Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery](https://jnis.bmj.com/content/15/7/655.full)], the authors investigated the utilization of *Triple Therapy* (TT) in the management of the dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysms treated with flow diverters. They concluded that compared with *Dual-antiplatelet Therapy* (DAPT), TT group had fewer ischemic strokes, less symptom progression, and overall better outcomes at last follow-up.

### Reference Points

- The anticoagulant dosage used ranged from 5 to 20 mg of rivaroxaban and 5 to 10 mg of apixaban.
- Mean duration of oral anti-coagulation therapy in TT group was *190* days.
- Telescoping multiple flow diverters should be kept to a minimum.
- Adjunctive coiling could be used to reduce mural flow and also to support the mesh, avoiding its prolapse into large fusiform sacs.
- Dual therapy was associated with less risk of intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding than TT, with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis.
- Cekirge and Saatci described the concept of stable remodeling for aneurysms that do not present angiographic occlusion but remain stable for a long period of time.^[[A New Aneurysm Occlusion Classification after the Impact of Flow Modification | American Journal of Neuroradiology](https://www.ajnr.org/content/37/1/19?ijkey=2364a648620d70d34216d7a25a376a42b61dd091&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha)]
